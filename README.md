# SE98KDE
Addon for nestoris/Win98SE icon theme that follows KDE colorscheme

# Make sure to have the awesome [Win98SE icon theme](https://github.com/nestoris/Win98SE) from [Nestoris](https://github.com/nestoris) installed.

This icon theme is not meant to be used as a standalone theme. It only includes actions, everything else is inherited from Win98SE.

The original does not look good with dark themes, this one should be more "dark theme friendly". As a bonus, I replaced the blue with the current highlight color. Take a look:
